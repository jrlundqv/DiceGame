# DiceGame 
A Java program for the "Game of Pig" dice game. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)

Complete with "dice graphics" created by a 2d array which is printed line by line into the terminal window. 
Features the option to play against a computer opponent.

I did this as practice for a programming exam at Ã˜stfold University College.

I was inspired to create this after watching this video by Numberphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULhRLGzoXQ0
